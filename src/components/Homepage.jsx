                        <li><span>Day 1 of the cohort:</span> The 15-day challenge starts today. One task, 15mins for 15days. Same time, everyday. Mark puts out a tweet or posts an IG story saying I'm taking up Prado's challenge and will be writing everyday for the next 15 days (Social Promise âœ…) Mark can't go back on his word now. </li>
                        <li><span>Day 7:</span> Mark wants to give up, or got writer's block, or just doesn't remember because the habit is not in his subconscious mind yet. This is where the community comes in. The mentors, the facilitators, will help you keep going.</li>
                        <li><span>Day 15:</span> Challenge completed. Extensively documented on social media and a notion page. Feeling "amazing" level max ðŸš€</li>
                        <li><span> Day 16:</span> Attend the closing ceremony of the cohort hosted by Prado and share your experiences, some laughs, a group picture and before you go to sleep you'd receive an NFT in your wallet. You earned it.</li>
                        <li><span>Day 17:</span> You'd know what you need to do when that specific clock hits. Everyday for the past 15 days you've written something, you'd do the same thing today.</li>
